    "## Implementing and Experimenting with JavaScript Objects with our game level (Ancient Greece)\n",
    "\n",
    "To our best understanding, Javascript objects are literally just objects with different properties. In our case, the game has many objects including the floor, the background, the player, the enemies, the blocks, and much more! These objects also have their own properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{ name: 'sandstone', id: 'jumpPlatform', class: BlockPlatform, data: this.assets.platforms.sandstone, xPercentage: 0.6, yPercentage: 0.34 },\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code here, we can see the object with its own properties:\n",
    "- *name: The name property sets a name for the object. In this case, it's set to 'sandstone'.\n",
    "- id: The id property specifies an identifier for the object. Here, it's set to 'jumpPlatform'.\n",
    "- class: The class property likely the class or \"type\" of the object. In this case, it's set to 'BlockPlatform'.\n",
    "- data: The data property holds some data associated with the object. \n",
    "- xPercentage: This property represents the horizontal position of the object as a percentage of the screen width/container. Here, it's set to 0.6, indicating 40% off from the right side, or 60% off from the left side.\n",
    "- yPercentage: Similarly to x-percentage, this property represents the vertical position of the object as a percentage of the screen width/container.It's set to 0.34, indicating 34%. This means that the object is placed at 66% off from the bottom of the screen, or 34% off from the top of the screen."

    "\n",
    "#### Code Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Switch Statement**:\n",
    "   - The `switch` statement evaluates `this.state.animation` to determine the current animation state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Case 'idle'**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   case 'idle':\n",
    "       this.setSpriteAnimation(this.playerData.idle[this.state.direction]);\n",
    "       break;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the current state is 'idle', it calls `setSpriteAnimation` with the idle animation data.\n",
    "   - `this.playerData.idle[this.state.direction]` accesses the idle animation data for the current direction (e.g., 'left' or 'right').\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Case 'walk'**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   case 'walk':\n",
    "       this.setSpriteAnimation(this.playerData.walk[this.state.direction]);\n",
    "       break;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the current state is 'walk', it calls `setSpriteAnimation` with the walk animation data.\n",
    "   - `this.playerData.walk[this.state.direction]` accesses the walk animation data for the current direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Case 'run'**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   case 'run':\n",
    "       this.setSpriteAnimation(this.playerData.run[this.state.direction]);\n",
    "       break;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the current state is 'run', it calls `setSpriteAnimation` with the run animation data.\n",
    "   - `this.playerData.run[this.state.direction]` accesses the run animation data for the current direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Case 'jump'**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   case 'jump':\n",
    "       this.setSpriteAnimation(this.playerData.jump[this.state.direction]);\n",
    "       break;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the current state is 'jump', it calls `setSpriteAnimation` with the jump animation data.\n",
    "   - `this.playerData.jump[this.state.direction]` accesses the jump animation data for the current direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Default Case**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   default:\n",
    "       console.error(`Invalid state: ${this.state.animation}`);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the current animation state does not match any of the defined cases ('idle', 'walk', 'run', 'jump'), it logs an error message to the console indicating an invalid state."

    "### GameEnv Array Of Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained earlier, `GameEnv.levels.push(this)` adds the current instance of `GameLevel` to the `GameEnv.levels` array. This allows the game environment to keep track of all levels. This happens in the GameLevel.js file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The array is placed in GameEnv.js as shown:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "static  levels  = [];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps with how transitions were previously coded, using array index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transitioning to the next level\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the game control function that transitions to the next level. It has been split into pieces to perform a deeper code analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async transitionToLevel(newLevel) {\n",
    "    this.inTransition = true;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This creates an asynchronous function called *transitionToLevel*\n",
    "- It takes thea parameter of `newLevel,` which is an object that is created in GameControl.js\n",
    "- If the game is transitioning (which it is, currently), this.inTransition is set to *true*. Once the transition is completed, this.inTransition is set to *false*.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "    GameEnv.destroy();\n",
    "```\n",
    "- In GameEnv.js, a method called `destroy` is created. It works by emptying the gameObjects array in reverse order, in order to fully clear out gameObjects. *Shown below.*\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "    static destroy() {\n",
    "        for (var i = GameEnv.gameObjects.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n",
    "            const gameObject = GameEnv.gameObjects[i];\n",

    "        }\n",
    "        GameEnv.gameObjects = [];\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the `destroy` method during transition is necessary, as eventually, the gameObjects array is going to be repopulated with more objects. At the same time, we also don't want objects from previous levels overflowing.\n",

    "- Then, all of the game objects in the `newlevel` are loaded in, using **newLevel.load()**\n",
    "- Lastly, the currentLevel value is set to the newLevel value\n",

    "### How does GameLoop call GameEnv method to update and draw objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that it's clear how transitions work in the GameLoop, it's important to identify that GameEnv update function is called to update and draw each GameObject. This code in the GameControl file is responsible for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```GameEnv.update();```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what this does is that it actually runs quite a complicated tree of functions. Here's how the structure is:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The ```GameEnv.update();``` function is called in GameControl. This runs the GameEnv update function.\n",
    " - This is the update function from GameEnv\n",
    ">  ```javascript\n",
    ">  static update() { \n",
    ">         if (GameEnv.player === null || GameEnv.player.state.isDying === false) {\n",
    ">             for (const gameObject of GameEnv.gameObjects) {\n",
    ">                 gameObject.update();\n",
    ">                 gameObject.serialize();\n",
    ">                 gameObject.draw();\n",
    ">             } \n",
    ">         }\n",
    ">     }\n",
    ">     ```\n",
    "\n",
    " - This static update function runs an if statement that checks if the player is null or the player is not dying. If either of these are true it will continue\n",
    "- For every gameObjects in the array of the gameObjects, it will run **the object's own update, serialize, and draw function.** \n"
