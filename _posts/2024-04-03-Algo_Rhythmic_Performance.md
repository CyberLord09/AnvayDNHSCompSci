Today morning at 8:30 I attended the Algo Rythmic Performance in the Performing Arts Center. I saw many differnt performances. The one that stood out to me the most was the quick sort vs. random sort performance as the background music, game host, and comparison of both algorythms. Here are the photos from the performance:
