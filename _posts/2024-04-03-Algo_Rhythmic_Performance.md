Today morning at 8:30 I attended the Algo Rythmic Performance in the Performing Arts Center. I saw many differnt performances. The one that stood out to me the most was the quick sort vs. random sort performance as the background music, game host, and comparison of both algorithms. I learned that the quicksort algorithm is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms and that it works by breaking an array into smaller ones and swapping the elements in the sub arrays by doing a comparison with the 'pivot' element. Here are the photos from the performance:
