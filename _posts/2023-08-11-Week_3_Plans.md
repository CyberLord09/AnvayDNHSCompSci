Throughout this week, my primary objectives involve refining the Snake game. I intend to implementa gradient background and replacing the block with an emoji of a pizza, and incorporating distinct difficulty modes. Concurrently, I am using a YouTube tutorial to make my own Hangman game. However, I will make substantial modifications to tailor the game to suit the specific requirements of my website. I hope to finish this by Thursday in class so I have no homework over the days.
